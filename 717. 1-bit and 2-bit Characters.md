## code_mine 

```
Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 66.45% of C++ online submissions for 1-bit and 2-bit Characters.
Memory Usage: 9.9 MB, less than 7.09% of C++ online submissions for 1-bit and 2-bit Characters.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        int N = bits.size();
        vector<int> can_start(N, 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if(0 == can_start[i]) { continue;}

            if (1 == bits[i]) {
                can_start[i + 1] = 0;
            }
        }

        return 1 == can_start[N - 1];
