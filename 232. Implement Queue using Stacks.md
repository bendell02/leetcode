## 
>
    Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
    
    push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
    pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
    peek() -- Get the front element.
    empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
    Example:
    
    MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();
    
    queue.push(1);
    queue.push(2);  
    queue.peek();  // returns 1
    queue.pop();   // returns 1
    queue.empty(); // returns false
    Notes:
    
    You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
    Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
    You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
